Example response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",

  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "api": "ok"
  },
  "uptime": 86400,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## Built-in Analytics

The site already includes comprehensive analytics through the admin dashboard:

### Existing Analytics Features
- **Platform Overview**: User, group, and review metrics
- **Trending Groups**: Performance tracking with trend scores
- **Group Growth Charts**: Time-series visualizations
- **Category Analytics**: Distribution and performance comparison
- **User Engagement**: Growth and activity metrics
- **Review Analytics**: Sentiment analysis and trends

### Accessing Analytics
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Select "Analytics" from the sidebar
4. Use time period filters for different views

### Database Views
The analytics system uses optimized database views:
- `group_growth_analytics`
- `category_analytics`

## Error Monitoring Strategy

Instead of paid error monitoring services, use:

### 1. Next.js Error Boundaries
- Built-in error handling for React components
- Graceful fallbacks for UI errors
- No additional setup required

### 2. Server Logs
- Use `console.error()` for server-side errors
- Monitor logs through your hosting provider
- Set up log aggregation if needed (many free options)

### 3. Browser Console
- Client-side errors appear in browser console
- Use browser dev tools for debugging
- Consider adding simple error reporting to admin dashboard

## Production Checklist

## Limitations and Trade-offs

### What You Get
- Basic uptime monitoring
- Comprehensive usage analytics
- Simple error tracking
- No ongoing costs

### What You Don't Get
- Real-time error alerts
- Advanced performance monitoring
- User session recordings
- Detailed error stack traces

### When to Upgrade
Consider paid monitoring tools when:
- Revenue justifies the cost
- Error volume becomes unmanageable
- Advanced debugging features are needed
- Real-time alerting becomes critical

## Troubleshooting

### UptimeRobot Issues
- **False positives**: Check health endpoint manually
- **Missing alerts**: Verify email settings
- **Monitor down**: Check URL and SSL certificate

### Health Endpoint Issues
- **Database errors**: Check Supabase connection
- **Timeout errors**: Optimize database queries
- **SSL issues**: Verify certificate configuration

### Analytics Issues
- **Missing data**: Check database views
- **Slow loading**: Optimize queries or add caching
- **Permission errors**: Verify admin access

## Future Enhancements

When budget allows, consider:
- **Paid UptimeRobot**: 1-minute intervals, more monitors
- **Log aggregation**: Centralized error tracking
- **Performance monitoring**: Core Web Vitals tracking
- **User analytics**: Privacy-friendly user behavior tracking

This minimal setup provides essential monitoring capabilities while keeping costs at zero, perfect for a bootstrapped project.
