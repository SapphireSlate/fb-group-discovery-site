# Enhanced User Profiles

This document outlines the Enhanced User Profiles feature for the Facebook Group Discovery Site.

## Overview

The Enhanced User Profiles feature provides comprehensive user profile pages with reputation, activity history, badges, and personalized recommendations. This feature is designed to increase user engagement and provide a more tailored experience for each user.

## Key Components

### 1. Basic Profile Information

- User display name and avatar
- Join date
- User bio and optional website
- Activity statistics (groups submitted, reviews written)

### 2. Reputation System

- Points earned for various contributions
- Reputation levels (Newcomer, Contributor, Regular, Expert, Authority, Legend)
- Visual reputation indicators
- Activity history showing how reputation was earned

### 3. Achievement Badges

- Badges awarded for specific accomplishments
- Visual badge display on profile page
- Badge details and date awarded
- Category-based badge organization (Contribution, Community, Discovery, Expertise)

### 4. Personalized Recommendations

- Recommended groups based on user activity and interests
- Recommendation algorithm that considers:
  - Categories of groups the user has interacted with
  - Tags from groups the user has submitted or rated highly
  - Excluding groups the user has already interacted with
  - Trending and popular groups as fallback options
- Visual display of recommendations with key metrics (rating, category, verification status)

## Implementation Details

### User Profile Page

The main profile page (`app/profile/[id]/page.tsx`) combines server and client components:

- Server-rendered basic profile information for SEO
- Client-side recommendations component for personalized content
- Reputation history display with pagination
- Badge display with filtering options

### Recommendation API

The recommendations API endpoint (`app/api/users/[id]/recommendations/route.ts`) implements the following algorithm:

1. Collect user activity data:
   - Groups submitted by the user
   - Reviews written by the user
   - Votes cast by the user

2. Extract user interests:
   - Categories of interest
   - Tags of interest
   - Previously interacted groups (to exclude)

3. Build personalized recommendations:
   - Prioritize groups in categories of interest
   - Exclude already interacted groups
   - Sort by average rating
   - Fall back to popular groups if not enough recommendations

4. Format and return results with relevant metadata

### Reputation System Integration

The enhanced profiles feature integrates with the reputation system:

- Display of current reputation level
- Visual indicators of progress
- History of reputation points earned
- Automatic level advancement

## User Experience
